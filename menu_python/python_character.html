    <h1>Python Character</h1>
    <hr><br><br>
    <h3>platform independent</h3>
    <p>Regardless of OS such as Windows, Linux, Android, MacOS, and iOS, you can use the program once you write the program.</p><br>
    <h3>Interpreter Language</h3>
    <p>The source code is interpreted at the time of execution without any separate translation process so that the computer can handle it. It is simple to write and requires less memory but is slow to execute.</p><br>
    <h3>object oriented</h3>
    <p>The program is written based on the unit module (object) rather than the order of execution.</p><br>
    <h3>dynamic typing language</h3>
    <p>Determine the type of data the program should use at the time the program runs.</p><br>
