        JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
        <ul>
          <li>HTML to define the content of web pages</li>
          <li>CSS to specify the layout of web pages</li>
          <li>JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages</li>
        </ul>
        Web pages are not the only place where JavaScript is used. Many desktop and server programs use JavaScript. Node.js is the best known. Some databases, like MongoDB and CouchDB, also use JavaScript as their programming language.

        <p class="note">
        JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.<br><br>
        JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.<br>
        ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.<br><br>
        You can read more about the different JavaScript versions in the chapter JS Versions.</p>
